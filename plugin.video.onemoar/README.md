use any code, just please give a little credit.

peace pooks. ✌️

- maybe MOAR to come...
- Exorcise the demons.
- Rewrite of "Icon Only/Hidden" progress dialog.
- Tweak for colorpicker to avoid carrying 527 png images with addon.  Bless whoever organized the color array values.
- Enable "Developer mode" to change the background.  Return to the settings category and select "Defaults" to clear it if needed.
- "Prefer TMDB artwork" setting now includes TMDB logo art, which is only slightly faster than Fanart.tv.
- "Flatten TV seasons" setting now includes "One Season", when only one season available episodes will list without season list.
- removed metadatahandler dependency, added Dradis watchedcache for local movie/episode watched tracking.
- file pruning: favorites.db, thumbs.db...
- removed beautifulsoup dependency, didn't see import anywhere.
- merged nexus/matrix versions as seems to be no difference in the addon code.
- other fixes/changes.
