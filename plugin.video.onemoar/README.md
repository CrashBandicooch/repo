# OneMoar

***Just get the pov guy to clone it and fix it. He’s already maintaining a clone of all the other addons anyways. What’s one more?"***

use any code, just please give a little credit.

peace pooks. ✌️

- maybe MOAR to come...
- Enable "Developer mode" to change the background.  Return to the settings category and select "Defaults" to clear it if needed.
- "Prefer TMDB artwork" setting now includes TMDB logo art, which is only slightly faster than Fanart.tv.
- "Flatten TV seasons" setting now includes "One Season", when only one season available episodes will list without season list.
- removed metadatahandler dependency, added Dradis watchedcache for local movie/episode watched tracking.
- several fixes/changes in `service.py` (recursive loop, remove xbmc import/use control functions, etc.)
- file pruning: favorites.db, thumbs.db...
- removed beautifulsoup dependency, didn't see import anywhere.
- merged nexus/matrix versions as seems to be no difference in the addon code.
- other fixes/changes.
